                                        Since 2000, we have provided optimal environmental solutions to satisfy the
                                        historical and social trends of environmental preservation. <br>
                                        We have understood that public health, safety, and environmental protection are essential
                                        for all businesses <br>and are enhancing the value of our business among our
                                        employees, customers, and the community. <br><br>

                                        We the leader of industry, we will comply with legal standards, suggest
                                        desirable standard models, and work closely with the society. <br>
                                        Our priorities are always "the safety of each employee and prevention of pollution by minimizing
                                        internal/external environmental impact."<br><br>

                                        For these purposes, we will build a health, safety, and environment management system <br>
                                        to pursue our goal, measure and review our performance for constant improvement. <br>
                                        Also, we will listen to the voices our stakeholders to operate the Company based on transparent management. <br><br>

                                        Understanding that the CEO is responsible for health, safety, and environment management, <br>
                                        I will provide all required human and financial resources to uphold our policies and <br>
                                        I hereby give OHSE Team Leader and his team members the responsibilities and authority to manage them. <br><br>

                                        We operate a system where harmful material discharge is monitored in real-time and preventive facilities are operated <br>
                                        efficiently to minimize harmful material discharge in relation to the related <br>
                                        affiliates of the Ministry of Environment to ensure complete transparency in waste treatment.
